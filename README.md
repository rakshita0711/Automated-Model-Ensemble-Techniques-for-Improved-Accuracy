The Iris dataset is a classic multiclass classification problem, where we have 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Each sample is described by 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Our goal is to develop an accurate classifier that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on these 4 features.
